    <h1>aqui van las cosas privadas (cosas p)
      <br />y aqui pondre la letra de creep:
      <br />When you were here before
I couldn’t look you in the eye
You’re just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
<br />You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You’re so fucking special
<br />But I’m a creep
I’m a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don’t belong here
<br />I don’t care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
<br />I want you to notice
When I’m not around
You’re so fucking special
I wish I was special
<br />But I’m a creep
I’m a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don’t belong here, oh, oh
<br />She’s running out again
She’s running out
Run, run, run, run!
Run!
<br />Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You’re so fucking special
I wish I was special
<br />But I’m a creep
I’m a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don’t belong here
I don’t belong here
